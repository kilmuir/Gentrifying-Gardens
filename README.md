## GEOB 472 Web Mapping Assignment: Community Gardens and Gentrification

  We often think of Vancouver’s community gardens as divorced from wider political and economic considerations. Emblematic of the local food movement and ostensibly promoting citizen engagement in food production, community gardens are promoted by people across the political spectrum. The number of such gardens has also vastly increased in recent years. My reason for mapping the distribution of Vancouver’s community gardens was to look at the phenomenon through a critical lens and to examine how community gardens play into larger patterns of gentrification.
 
  Vancouver provides significant tax breaks to landholders for providing ‘community garden’ space - see <a href = 'https://www.bcbusiness.ca/How-Vancouver-property-developers-cash-in-on-community-gardens' target = "_blank"> here</a>. This subsidy, coupled with the positive public image of such gardens has led to the rapid increase in their number. Noah Quastel (2009) has argued that the commodification of ‘green’ lifestyles and consumer behaviour as represented in Vancouver’s corporate ‘community’ gardens works as an agent of gentrification. This link remains masked, however, by the pervasive human-nature divide that dominates much of the discourse of the mainstream environmental movement. Things like community gardens are seen as an environmental ‘good’; their potentially negative social and political-economic are obscured. This positive image further serves to de-historicize such gardens and seemingly remove them from the greater context of local food production, which is embroiled with issues of race, gender and class.

  My original aim for this project was to create an interactive, cumulative time-series map that showed the development of community gardens, differentiated in jurisdiction (public/private) by colour and size by symbol size. This proved to be a bit ambitious, so the map is still a work in progress. The submitted map is a proportional symbol map which shows gardens based on size and has basic interactivity in that the points are clickable and provide information as to the size, jurisdiction and website of each garden. 

  The map went through several iterations visually. The first was simply a style created in Mapbox studio that included the gardens as a layer. This was unsatisfactory as my original style was too cluttered and the map provided no interactivity and little information. Based on a peer review which identified the visual hierarchy as over-emphasising the contextual layers, I decided to abandon my original style and to instead use the Mapbox ‘minimo’ style, modified slightly to suit my needs. The style was chosen and modified to present an absolute minimum of visual clutter while still providing adequate context. Since I wanted to keep the symbols green to follow logical colour connotation (the commodification of ‘green’ as well as the green of gardens), it was important that parks and other features that might often be coloured green in cartographic representations were shaded differently. It was important, however, to keep layers such as parks for context, since many gardens are in close proximity to, or even within parks.

  While I don’t feel that I necessarily accomplished my goal of a critical cartographic representation of Vancouver’s community gardens – the result seems more like a reference map – the project did clarify for me a lot of things about the process of web mapping. As a result, I think I will continue to refine it and to attempt to achieve what I set out to map at the onset of the project: an interactive time series highlighting private-sector community garden development.
